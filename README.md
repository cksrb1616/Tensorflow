Tensorflow_ML-DL
==================

As a learner of economics, finding a numerical rule is one of the most exciting projects. All scripts in this repository are about diverse model of Deep Learning based on Tensorflow. Cifar10 and MNIST are used as data. Starting from the simple linear regression, **more complicated and challenging models** will be done in the near future.

Current Trials
1. Simple Linear Regression
2. Simple Classification
3. K-means
4. CNN with Flatten layer
5. CNN with LeNet model
6. CNN with MaxPool2D
